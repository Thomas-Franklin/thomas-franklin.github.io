Yes, my last update was correct.

> I did have good intentions of starting a semi regular blog...

The Open Banking stuff? I moved on from [there](https://loyalbe.io), joined another [company](https://rapid7.com) and have since started a whole new role as an [SRE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_reliability_engineering) at [Trustpilot](https://uk.trustpilot.com/).

I hope this blog will be kept more up to date, and hope to share some gotchas as I delve deeper in to all things cloud and whatnots.
